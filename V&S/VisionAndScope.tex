\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background, Opportunity, and Customer Needs}
When starting their Case Western Reserve experiences, new students are often overwhelmed by such sudden, dramatic (sometimes traumatic) changes in their lives. Many have trouble with the basics of surviving at CWRU. Some cannot find their classes, some do not know when the dining halls are open, and so forth. The stress induced by such challenges can often adversely affect a student's educational and social life. Even beyond the treacherous first few weeks of school, both current students and faculty waste time and effort trying to determine various information about CWRU using widespread and disparate resources.\\

\noindent A mobile software system that contains most, if not all, of the information any CWRU student or faculty member could want on a daily basis would greatly increase the efficiency of the users. The system will allow users to make better use of the many resources offered by CWRU. Centralizing access to these resources will not only enhance users' efficiency, it should also reduce their frustrations due to the inadequacies of other resources. The form of the system will be a Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 application. The mobile nature of a phone application will further enhance the efficiency of users.

\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}[BO-1:]
\item Reduce difficulty experienced by new students due to unfamiliar CWRU environment.
\item Increase general efficiency of CWRU students and faculty by facilitating their uses of certain CWRU resources.
\item Centralize access to most commonly used CWRU resources.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[SC-1:]
\item 50\% of all Windows phone users in the Case community actively use the application.
\item Application received at least 10 positive reviews on the Windows Marketplace.
\item 3 months after release, more positive reviews then negative reviews.
\item Recognition of application in university literature (such as \emph{The Case Daily})
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Business Risks}
\begin{enumerate}[BR-1:]
\item Application fails certification for the Windows Phone Store.
\item Windows Phone is a currently less utilized application platform than its competitors, increasing the risk that fewer students will use the application.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
For students who currently struggle with knowing where their classes are, getting to classes on time, or using the myriad of other resources CWRU provides to its students, CWRUtility is an app which will solve these problems. It is an elegantly designed mobile application which will provide useful information and centralize the services students use most.
\subsection{Major Features}
\begin{enumerate}[FE-1:]
\item Integrates with the Student Information System to schedule students' courses.
\item Provide map of CWRU campus with detailed information on students' course locations.
\item Integrates with NextBus, Inc. to provide a schedule for the "greenie" system.
\item Displays hours, locations, and phone numbers for Case services
\item Displays menus for both major dining halls.
\item Integrates with \emph{The Case Daily} and \emph{The Observer} to display daily news.
\item Integrates with the e-Suds system to provide laundry information.
\item Provides the current 5-year academic calendar.
\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}[{A}S-1:]
\item Mobile device is equipped with an internet connection.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[DE-1:]
\item This application depends on the continuing functionality of the described services.
\end{enumerate}
