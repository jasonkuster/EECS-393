\end{enumerate} 
\subsection{Using Internet}
Window's Mobile devices are equipped with  internet connectivity that will be implemented in the NextBus, Campus Map, eSuds, Menus, and Case News features. If you can not connect to the internet or one of the online resources responsible for providing data to one of these features goes down the feature and/or application may not function correctly or completely. 

\section{Main Page}
The Main Page is the first page you will view when you open the CWRUtility application. On it is a list of 6 resources: Next Bus, Campus Map, eSuds, Directory, Menus, and Case News. Tapping any feature name on the title page will take you to that feature. Next Bus and eSuds may display information next to their name based on the settings you can establish when using those features as described below. 

\section{Next Bus}
\subsection{Overview}
This feature displays the 3 soonest arrival times for a bus route, in a direction, at a specified stop. The user can return to the Main Page by hitting the back arrow at the bottom of the phone.
\subsection{Selectioning Stops}
To get the schedule of a "greenie" bus relevant to your interest, customize which route, direction, and stop you want to view information for. To do this, tap the grey boxes which label "stop", "route", and "direction". This action will change your phone's screen to a list of the available options for that selection. After making selections for route, direction, and stop, you can get estimates for when the next 3 buses will arrive by tapping the "Go" button. This will update the 3 numbers near the top of the screen: these numbers describe the time in minutes until that the bus going in the selected direction will visit that stop. These numbers will update as time passes. However if you revise what route, direction, or stop you would like to view information for you will need to hit the go button again. Please note that not all bus routes run all day, for example the North Loop only runs after 5:30 PM, and so if the route you wish to view is not currently running instead of loading a countdown for bus arrivals "No Prediction Available" will be loaded at the top of the screen. The user can return to the Main Page by hitting the back arrow at the bottom of the phone.
\subsection{Set Default}
